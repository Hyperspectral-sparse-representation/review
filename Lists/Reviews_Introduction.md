|  1   | In this note, we present a general background overview of spectral graph theory, with an emphasis on how it can be used to analyze HSI data (in particular, to perform nonlinear dimensionality reduction as well as segmentation and classification). We include examples from real-world data, and also point out some of the issues (such as computational complexity and storage requirements) that need to be addressed.     |  David Gillis Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC USA    | An introduction to spectral graph techniques for the analysis of hyperspectral image data    | 24-27 June 2014   |Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS) | 0912 14:07  |[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8077523/)|
