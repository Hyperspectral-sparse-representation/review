|  1   |   the reconstructed pixel of interest has similar spectral characteristics to its four nearest neighbors. The second approach is via a joint sparsity model where hyperspectral pixels in a small neighborhood around the test pixel are simultaneously represented by linear combinations of a few common training samples, which are weighted with a different set of coefficients for each pixel. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several real hyperspectral images for classification.    |   Yi Chen   |  Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Dictionary-Based Sparse Representation   | 12 May 2011    | TGRS | 0923 14:54  |[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5766028/)|
