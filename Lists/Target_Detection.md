|  1   | This algorithm is based on the concept that a pixel in HSI lies in a low-dimensional subspace and thus can be represented as a sparse linear combination of the training samples. The sparse representation (a sparse vector corresponding to the linear combination of a few selected training samples) of a test sample can be recovered by solving an l0-norm minimization problem.      | Yi Chen     |  Sparse Representation for Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery   | 10 February 2011   |  IEEE Signal Processing Society   |0923 15:11|[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5711635/)|
