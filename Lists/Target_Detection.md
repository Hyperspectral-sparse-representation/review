|  1   |   The reconstructed pixel of interest has similar spectral characteristics to its four nearest neighbors. The second approach is via a joint sparsity model where hyperspectral pixels in a small neighborhood around the test pixel are simultaneously represented by linear combinations of a few common training samples, which are weighted with a different set of coefficients for each pixel. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several real hyperspectral images for classification.    |   Yi Chen   |  Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Dictionary-Based Sparse Representation   | 12 May 2011    | TGRS | 0923 14:54  |[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5766028/)|
|  2   | This algorithm is based on the concept that a pixel in HSI lies in a low-dimensional subspace and thus can be represented as a sparse linear combination of the training samples. The sparse representation (a sparse vector corresponding to the linear combination of a few selected training samples) of a test sample can be recovered by solving an l0-norm minimization problem.      | Yi Chen     |  Sparse Representation for Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery   | 10 February 2011   |  IEEE Signal Processing Society   |0923 15:11|[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5711635/)|
