|  1   |   The reconstructed pixel of interest has similar spectral characteristics to its four nearest neighbors. The second approach is via a joint sparsity model where hyperspectral pixels in a small neighborhood around the test pixel are simultaneously represented by linear combinations of a few common training samples, which are weighted with a different set of coefficients for each pixel. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several real hyperspectral images for classification.    |   Yi Chen   |  Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Dictionary-Based Sparse Representation   | 12 May 2011    | TGRS | 0923 14:54  |[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5766028/)|
|  2   |  two manifold-based sparse representation algorithms are proposed to exploit the local structure of the test samples in corresponding sparse representations for enforcing smoothness across neighboring samples' sparse representations. Using techniques from regularization and local invariance, two manifold-based regularization terms are incorporated into the â„“ 1 -based objective function.     |   Yuan Yan Tang   | Manifold-Based Sparse Representation for Hyperspectral Image Classification    | 22 April 2014   |IGRSS    |1004 13:41|[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6803993)|
